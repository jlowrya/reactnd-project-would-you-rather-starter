# Would You Rather?
## Overview
This project is being developed as a part of the [React nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The aim is to create a Would You Rather game using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Information about the project as given by Udacity can be found in the UDACITY_README.md file.

## Project Planning
Having not yet finisehd the Redux course material, I am developing the project in stages. The initial stage was designing the wireframes. Currently, I am creating all of the components, starting with the lowest level ones and working my way up. Once all of the components are created, I will begin stitching the application together using react state. By that time, I will hopefully be finished with the Redux course material, and begin integrating Redux into the project.
